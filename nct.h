/*
 * The time-stamp counter on recent Intel processors is reset to zero each time
 * the processor package has RESET asserted. From that point onwards the invariant
 * TSC will continue to tick constantly across frequency changes, turbo mode and
 * ACPI C-states. All parts that see RESET synchronously will have their TSC's
 * completely synchronized. This synchronous distribution of RESET is required
 * for all sockets connected to a single PCH. For multi-node systems RESET might
 * not be synchronous.
 *
 * The biggest issue with TSC synchronization across multiple threads/cores/packages
 * is the ability for software to write the TSC. The TSC is exposed as MSR 0x10.d
 * Software is able to use WRMSR 0x10 to set the TSC. However, as the TSC continues
 * as a moving target, writing it is not guaranteed to be precise. For example a SMI
 * (System Management Interrupt) could interrupt the software flow that is attempting
 * to write the time-stamp counter immediately prior to the WRMSR. This could mean
 * the value written to the TSC could vary by thousands to millions of clocks.
